# tabTracker
tabTracker is a Google Chrome extension that keeps a running list of your open tabs, and the time since you last opened them.

tabTracker lists your tabs in order of most recent visit, and gives you the option to close your oldest and most decrepit tabs from the extension page.

Built in pure HTML/CSS/Javascript using the Google Chrome Extensions API
